# travel-planner-app
Travel planner app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using React and Vite

I've created a comprehensive travel planner app with React and Vite. Here's what the app includes:
Key Features

A weekly calendar layout with days from Sunday to Sunday
Time slots in 30-minute increments from 8:00 AM to 11:30 PM
Ability to add different types of events (check-ins, travel times, tours, RSVPs, etc.)
Color-coded events by category
Event duration options (30 min, 1 hour, 1.5 hours, 2 hours, etc.)
A sidebar for managing activities and restaurants lists
Export functionality to download all data as an Excel spreadsheet

Code Structure
The code is organized into several components:

Main App container
Calendar with day columns
Event management (form and display)
Activity and restaurant lists
Utility functions for dates and Excel export

How to Use

Navigate through weeks using the arrow buttons
Click on any time slot to add a new event
Fill in event details (title, description, type, duration)
Add activities and restaurants in the sidebar
Export your entire trip plan to Excel with the "Export to Excel" button

This implementation can easily be expanded to support 2-week trips or longer by adjusting the calendar navigation and display logic.
